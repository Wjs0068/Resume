            When I created my first script, I knew that nothing would ever be the same. I knew at that moment that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life. But software development has never been "just a job" for me. It has offered a challenge for me that allows me to actively learn and develop my coding skills with new technologies. What started with a simple program, has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as I gain more experience. I am eager to share my ideas and hear the ideas of others. Below are projects that showcase my skills and general background in developing software.
